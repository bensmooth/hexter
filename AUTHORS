hexter includes code taken from the following sources:

    The sound generation code descends most directly from Juan
    Linietsky's rx-saturno, copyright (c) 2002 under the GNU General
    Public License version 2.

    Major portions of the event handling code are derived from
    Fluidsynth, copyright (c) 2003 Peter Hanappe and others, under
    the GNU General Public License version 2.

    Portions of the DSSI interface and OSC handling code come from
    Chris Cannam and Steve Harris's public domain DSSI example code.

    The ALSA MIDI input is based on specimen, copyright (c) 2004
    Pete Bessman under the GNU General Public License version 2.

The following people have assisted in hexter's development:

    Jamie Bullock's enthusiasm and help with reverse engineering
    made the LFO and modulation code happen. Jamie also contributed
    the NRPN support.

    Martin Tarenskeen contributed improvements to hexter's DX7 patch
    loading code.

    Rui Nuno Capela and Andreas MÃ¼ller squashed crash-causing bugs.

hexter is also very much the result of an ongoing cumulative effort
by a large number of DX7 and synthesis enthusiasts, including:

    - John Chowning, who invented FM synthesis, and told us about it
        in (among other places) "The Synthesis of Complex Audio
        Spectra by Means of Frequency Modulation", JAES 21:526-534,
        1973.

    - Yamaha, who made my beloved TX7s and KX88.

    - Chowning and Dave Bristow published "FM Theory and
        Applications", which I never obtained, but is cited by many
        of the other sources I used, such as:

    - T. Yala Abdullah's website explaining OL-to-TL conversions and
        modulation indices.

    - Russell Pinkston, Jeff Harrington, Doug Walter, and Sylvain
        Marchand, creators of the dx72csnd DX7-to-csound patch
        converter and orchestra files, upon which much of subsequent
        emulation efforts has been based.

    - Godric Wilkie, who supplied pitch envelope timings
        (http://www.gozen.demon.co.uk/godric/synth/yam.html).

    - Bo Tomlyn and his "Programming the DX7" article.

    - Howard Massey and his "Tricks and Traps of the DX7" article.

    - Members of the Linux Audio Developers list, for much wisdom
        regarding digital audio and synthesis.

Thanks everybody!  Ain't open source great?
